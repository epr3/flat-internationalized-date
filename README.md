### Flat Internationalized Date

This library is a fork of (@internationalized/date)[https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/tree/main/packages/%40internationalized/date] by Adobe.

Most of the functionality has been ported over from `@internationalized/date`

Its purpose is to provide an interface for representing and manipulating dates and times in a locale-aware manner without using ES6 classes.

Main usage of this library would be with Vue or any other framework that requires the use of JS primitives.

More updates to come.
